Why ELN?::

    The Fedora distribution is, among other things, an https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/fedora-and-red-hat-enterprise-linux/[upstream] for
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). By adjusting buildroot and assorted
    configurations, ELN allows Fedora contributors who work on RHEL and other similarly targeted downstreams to judge the state of upstream from their perspective. The benefit for the Fedora distribution is that contributors who work on both upstream and downstream stay more continuously connected to the state of Fedora -- especially, but not exclusively, Rawhide.

What is the role of ELN with respect to CentOS Stream?::

     ELN is a continuous rebuild of Fedora Rawhide sources. Once in a while a
     certain snapshot of the ELN is used to bootstrap the new CentOS Stream for
     the new major RHEL release. There is no continuous synce between ELN and
     ant version of the CentOS Stream. Bootstrap activity happens only once for
     each CentOS Stream version. See the picture:

What is the differences between Rawhide and ELN?::

    For the majority of packages, there is little or no difference between Rawhide and 
    ELN packages.  They are the same versions, usually built on the same libraries.  But
    there are some buildroot differences in global macros that can cause build differences.
    
    Note: Many packages have %if fedora / rhel conditions that cause Rawhide and ELN packages
    to differ.  Listing all of those differences is beyond the scope of this document.

When should I use the rpm macro %\{eln}?::

    Never.  If you think you need to, file a ticket on the 
    https://github.com/fedora-eln/eln/issues/new/choose[issue tracker].
